Remove leading zeroes and duplicates from a poorly formatted list of IPv4 Addresses

This article (https://www.extendoffice.com/documents/excel/4946-excel-sort-ip-address.html#a1) expects you to use Excel to sort and remove unique IPv4 addresses out of a list of addresses.  What if you don't have Excel (on a modern workstation)?  What if you don't want the leading zeroes this leaves behind?  What if you just want to accomplish this with a single Powershell line?
